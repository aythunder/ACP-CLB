# ACP-CLB
we introduce a model that utilizes the pre-trained ProtBERT and processes different types of features separately for ACP classification.
# How do we use protbert?
we utilize the ProtBERT model proposed by Elnaggar et al. in 2021.
The pre-trained parameters can be downloaded from https://huggingface.co/Rostlab/prot_bert.
